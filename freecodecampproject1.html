            <h3 id="headline">Here are 10 MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS OF SHAHEED BHAGAT SINGH</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>HE DEDICATED HIMSELF TO THE CAUSE OF INDIA'S INDEPENDENCE IN HIS TEENAGE.</strong><br> At a mere age of 16, he was completely and whole-heartedly dedicated to the cause of national liberation and service of the country.</li>
                <li><strong>HE WAS FAMOUS AS AN IMPECCABLE ORATOR AND WRITER.</strong><br> Lahore, as a hub of culture, multi-ethnic and cross-section of ideologies, provided Shaheed Bhagat Singh a prominent platform for his political work and struggle for freedom.</li>
                <li><strong>HE BECAME A LEADER OF THE HINDUSTAN REPUBLICAN ASSOCIATION.</strong><br>In these challenging times the sole absconders of the Kakori incident, Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad, took up the reigns of the party and emerged as the leaders of the Hindustan Republican Association.</li>
                <li><strong>BHAGAT SINGH FOUNDED NAUJAWAN BHARAT IN 1926.</strong><br> The organization organized periodic protests, lectures and public meetings espousing revolutionary ideas of freedom, equality and economic emancipation.</li>
                <li><strong>HE SERVED AS AN ICON FOR REVOLUTIONARY YOUTHS ACROSS INDIA.</strong><br> The intense patriotism of Bhagat Singh coupled with cultivated idealism, made him an ideal icon for the youth of his generation.</li>
                <li><strong>HE BOOSTED REVOLUTIONARY MORALE WITH THE ASSASSINATION OF J.P. SAUNDERS.</strong><br> The success of the Saunders murder brought prestige to the revolutionaries and created much sensation among the students.</li>
                <li><strong>BHAGAT SINGH VOLUNTARILY GOT ARRESTED TO POPULARIZE THE INDIAN REVOLUTION.</strong><br>  In Indian political novels chronicling the independence movement, a pro-independence sentiment is often characterized by characters shouting this slogan.</li>
                <li><strong>HIS HUNGER STRIKE IN JAIL STIRRED NATIONWIDE PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR HIS CAUSE.</strong><br> This hunger strike lasted 63 days and ended with the British finally accepting defeat and succumbing to his wishes.</li>
                <li><strong>THE DAY OF HIS DEATH IS OBSERVED AS MARTYR'S DAY IN INDIA.</strong><br> At a mere age of 23, giving up his life for the freedom, glory, welfare and progress of the nation is by far the greatest achievement of Shaheed Bhagat Singh.</li>
                <li><strong>BHAGAT SINGH REMAINS A HUGELY POPULAR FIGURE IN CONTEMPORARY INDIA.</strong><br> In addition, he was voted the “Greatest Indian” in a poll by the Indian magazine India Today in 2008, ahead of Subhash Chandra Bose and Mahatma Gandhi. This gives an idea of his popularity among contemporary Indian people.</li>
